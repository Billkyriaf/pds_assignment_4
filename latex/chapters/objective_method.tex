\subsubsection*{Objective}

The main focus of this assignment is to compare the pthreads and openCilk models on multiple aspects. The most important is the performance of the benchmarking
algorithm. The algorithm used as mentioned before is Huffman encoding. The sequential version of the algorithm was coded from scratch and can be found on the
accompanying Github repository along with the parallel implementations.

\subsubsection*{Methodology}
All of the test will be performed on the Ryzen 7 5700G, which is an 8 core 16 thread CPU. The variables of the tests will be the number of threads used and the size of the input file.
All other variables are kept constant in a way that other components, such as disk read and write speeds, don't interfere with the results. The input file will be
a text file containing \href{https://loremipsum.io/}{lorem ipsum } which produces character frequency distribution as shown in the introduction of this document.
The results will include an absolute time comparison and a speed up trend compared to the sequential implementation.

\subsubsection*{Key differentiation}
The main differentiation of this assignment for the previous papers is that it will also compare the ease of use of the two models as well as the functionality
the two frameworks provide. Those aspects are inherently subjective and will be discussed in the results section.
