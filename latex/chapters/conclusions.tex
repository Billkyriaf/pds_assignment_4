Comparing the results of the testing revealed that the performance of the 
openCilk library is very close to that of the Pthreads. In addition openCilk
is easier to use and significantly faster to implement compared to the Pthreads
library. The work stealing architecture of the openCilk makes it very 
competitive with all the other parallel programming models.

This assignment did not include multiCilk in the comparison. MultiCilk is the 
combination of the work stealing architecture (thread pools) with the POSIX 
locks and mutexes. The implementation of the algorithm used in this assignment
did not require any inter-thread communication or thread synchronization, so
the usage of multiCilk was not required.
